Power BI Business 360 Project
AtliQ Hardware has been expanding quickly lately. They've decided to start using Power BI for data analytics. This is their first time trying it out, and they hope it'll help them beat their competitors and make smarter decisions based on data. They want this project to answer all the questions stakeholders have about finances, sales, marketing, and the supply chain.
